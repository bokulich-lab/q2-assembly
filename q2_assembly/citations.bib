  abstract = {Summary: During the past years we have witnessed the rapid development of new metagenome assembly methods. Although there are many benchmark utilities designed for single-genome assemblies, there is no well-recognized evaluation and comparison tool for metagenomic-specific analogues. In this article, we present MetaQUAST, a modification of QUAST, the state-of-the-art tool for genome assembly evaluation based on alignment of contigs to a reference. MetaQUAST addresses such metagenome datasets features as (i) unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference sequences, (ii) huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple genomes and (iii) presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs. We demonstrate MetaQUAST performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real datasets. Availability and implementation: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/metaquast.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized genomics in early 2000s. The next revolution came with the era of long-read sequencing. These technological advances along with novel computational approaches became the next step towards the automatic pipelines capable to assemble nearly complete mammalian-size genomes. Results: In this manuscript, we demonstrate performance of the state-of-the-art genome assembly software on six eukaryotic datasets sequenced using different technologies. To evaluate the results, we developed QUAST-LG?a tool that compares large genomic de novo assemblies against reference sequences and computes relevant quality metrics. Since genomes generally cannot be reconstructed completely due to complex repeat patterns and low coverage regions, we introduce a concept of upper bound assembly for a given genome and set of reads, and compute theoretical limits on assembly correctness and completeness. Using QUAST-LG, we show how close the assemblies are to the theoretical optimum, and how far this optimum is from the finished reference.},
